        HTML, known as HyperText Markup Language, serves as the foundation of every webpage on the internet. It uses tags to structure content, defining elements like paragraphs, headings, images, and links. These tags create a framework that web browsers use to interpret and display information consistently across various devices. HTML's simplicity and flexibility make it indispensable for building and organizing digital content, shaping the interactive experiences that define our online world.

        CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, plays a crucial role in web design by controlling the visual presentation of web pages. It allows developers to define styles for HTML elements, including colors, fonts, spacing, and layout. CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying properties such as `color`, `font-size`, `margin`, and `padding` to achieve desired aesthetics and functionality. This separation of content (HTML) and presentation (CSS) enables efficient site management and enhances user experience by ensuring consistency and flexibility in design across different platforms and screen sizes. CSS's ability to cascade styles and prioritize rules provides developers with powerful tools to create modern, responsive, and visually appealing websites that meet both aesthetic and functional requirements.

                        Now my target is know what is HTML ans CSS. Here a little bit of discribsion on it. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is used to create and organize web pages. "HyperText" means text with links, and "Markup" means code that structures the page. CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is used to style web pages. "Cascading" means the order of styles matters, and "Style" refers to the look of the page, like colors and fonts. My current target is to learn the basics of HTML and CSS so I can make and design web pages.</p>

                        <p class="learnedparagraph">
                            HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the code used to create and structure web pages. Basic elements include tags, which define parts of the page, attributes that add extra information, and links that connect to other pages. HTML can also include text, images, videos, forms, buttons, paragraphs, headers, lists, and tables. These elements work together to form the structure of a web page.

                        <p class="learnedparagraph">
                            CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is used to style web pages. It changes how HTML elements look, such as colors, fonts, and layouts. CSS rules consist of selectors (which elements to style), properties (what to change), and values (how to change it). The "cascading" means the order of rules matters, with some rules taking priority over others.

                            JavaScript is a programming language for web development that adds interactivity to websites. It allows developers to manipulate content, respond to user actions like clicks, and create dynamic effects. Key components include variables for storing data, functions for performing tasks, conditions for decision-making, and loops for repeating actions. JavaScript works closely with HTML and CSS to enhance the functionality and user experience of web pages.

                            The topic "I Need Support" could focus on providing assistance or help in various contexts, such as customer support, technical assistance, emotional support, or guidance. In web development, this could relate to creating user-friendly interfaces, providing accessible resources, or offering responsive customer service. If you need specific support related to web development or any other area, it's about ensuring that assistance is available when needed to facilitate a positive experience or outcome.

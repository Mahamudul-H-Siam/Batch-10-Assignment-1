        JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a dynamic programming language that powers interactivity on the web. It runs directly in the browser, allowing developers to create responsive and engaging user experiences. JS can manipulate webpage content, respond to user actions like clicks and keystrokes, and dynamically update pages without reloading. It complements HTML and CSS by adding behavior and functionality, making websites more dynamic and interactive. JavaScript's versatility extends beyond web development, with applications ranging from server-side development to mobile app development, cementing its role as a cornerstone of modern web technology.
